Historically, patients treated dose cohorts three, dose next cohort determined number DLTs observed current cohort. Algorithmic designs like simple 3+3 design (Carter 1973) disadvantages recognized statistics community, see e.g., (Paoletti, Ezzalfani, Le Tourneau 2015). Fundamentally, escalation rules 3+3 design statistical justification (Storer 1989) terms estimating MTD. Moreover, extended address today’s Phase trials, extension cohorts, dose escalation drug combinations optimal biological dose determination, naming just prominent challenges. Hence model-based dose escalation designs like continual reassessment method (CRM) (O’Quigley, Pepe, Fisher 1990) gained increasing interest due need efficient informative Phase trials. designs based statistical inference, dose-toxicity regression models backbone, therefore flexible adaptation various complex trial designs. Importantly, avoid fixing dose levels advance. wider comparison algorithmic model based designs see e.g., (Jaki, Clive, Weir 2013). However, wide-spread implementation designs hindered need either licensing specialized commercial software (thus losing flexibility) programming design simulations scratch project (thus losing efficiency). models underlying model-based dose escalation procedures can easily fit standard software capability fit generalized linear models, e.g., PROC MIXED SAS ( Institute Inc. 2003), glm Stata (StataCorp 2015) R ( Core Team 2016), still software solutions available dedicated dose escalation studies. commercial packages East (Cytel Inc. 2016) ADDPLAN (Consultants 2025) offer extensions basic design software dose escalation studies (ESCALATE East df ADDPLAN) implementing algorithmic 3+3 design various versions CRM.

Next, specify scenarios simulations. example, simulations using DLT model efficacy model LogisticIndepBeta Effloglog objects, respectively, can specify scenario : true DLT, efficacy gain curves can obtained. can see corresponding curves plot chunk Truecurves Using commands, can obtained DLT (red), efficacy(blue) gain (green) curves also corresponding true values TD30 (TDtargetEndOfTrial), TD35 (TDtargetDuringTrial) Gstar. addition, scenario DLT efficacy can used cases (modal estimates MCMC samples). EffFlexi class object used simulations. Using DLT scenario new efficacy scenario specified corresponding curves can also plotted : plot chunk TruecurvesFlexi Similarly, also get DLT, efficacy gain values corresponding real values TD30, TD35 Gstar. establishing real scenarios, can simulate trials. First, look two examples Effloglog class object used efficacy model. show first example MCMC samples involved: simulate function used cases simulate trials specified scenarios. , specified true precision (trueNu) efficacy responses 1/0.025. words, used value 0.025 true variance efficacy responses simulation. arguments args,nsim, seed parallel, please refer earlier examples details specification description details. MCMC samples used, can also specify simulations similar way additional argument mcmcOptions EffFlexi class object used efficacy model, generate simulations follows: specification arguments object, args, trueDLE, trueEff, mcmcOptions,nsim,seed,parallel please refer earlier examples details. addition, two arguments used EffFlexi class efficacy model used simulations: First, trueSigma2 specified true variance efficacy responses trueSigma2betaW true variance random walk model used simulation. Furthermore, can also plot, summarize plot summary simulated results using plot summary function: plot chunk plotsimulationresults1 plot chunk plotsimulationresults2 plot chunk plotsimulationresults3 plots give overview final dose recommendations trial trajectories. addition, also give summary efficacy variance also random walk model variance EffFlexi class object used efficacy model. , summary plot summary simulations can obtained : plot chunk summarysimulationresults1 plot chunk summarysimulationresults2 plot chunk summarysimulationresults3 first simulation, Sim1 trial stop ratio 95% credibility interval bounds current estimate minimum TD30(TDtargetEndOfTrial) Gstar less equal 5. last two simulations, Sim2 Sim3, use trials stop either maximum 72 patients treated ratio 95% credibility interval less equal 5. can see simulations trials require total around 60 patients study. reminder, dual endpoint dose escalation design uses two separate models describe dose-responses relationship, gain function used determine next best dose final recommended dose end trial. specifically end trial, recommend dose level closest minimum final estimate TD30 (TDtargetEndOfTrial) Gstar. DLT efficacy scenario used first, Sim1 second simulations, Sim2 . real TD30 (TDtargetEndOfTrial) given summary 152.6125 mg dose level doseGrid closest real TD30 150 mg. real Gstar 130.0097 mg dose level dose grid closest Gstar 125 mg. case, real Gstar less real TD30 expect recommendations made dose level close real Gstar. words, scenario, expect recommendations made 125 mg. can see simulated results agrees expecting. summaries plots summaries, 125 mg dose level selected often simulations. scenario last simulation, Sim3, real TD30 real Gstar 125 mg. Since real TD30 greater real Gstar, also expect recommendations made close real Gstar scenario. can see simulated results summary plot summary, procedure also recommends 125 mg often simulations, agrees real scenario. Now, also look fitted dose-DLT dose-efficacy curves obtained three simulations. plots summaries, can see cases, fitted dose-DLT curves (solid-red curve) approximate well real dose-DLT curve (solid-black curve). 95% credibility interval DLT curve (broken-red curves) also given MCMC samples involved simulation. contrast, can see fitted efficacy curve (solid-blue curve) gives good fit real efficacy curve (solid-black) cases. approximation real efficacy curve better linear linear log-log model, Effloglog used, compared flexible form , EffFlexi used. addition, can also see 95% credibility interval efficacy curve (broken-blue line) MCMC sampling efficacy responses involved.","code":"data2 <- DataDual(doseGrid = seq(25, 300, 25))  data4 <- DataDual(   x = c(25, 50, 50, 75, 100, 100, 225,
