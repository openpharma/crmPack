# `ModelPseudo`

**\[stable\]**

`ModelPseudo` is the parent class for models that express their prior in
the form of pseudo data (as if there is some data before the trial
starts).

## Usage

``` r
.DefaultModelPseudo()
```

## Note

Typically, end users will not use the `.DefaultModelPseudo()` function.
