\item{probmin}{the prior probability of exceeding \code{threshmin} at the
minimum dose (default: 0.05)}

maximum dose (default: 0.05)}

\description{
This function constructs a minimally informative prior, which is captured in
a \code{\linkS4class{LogisticNormal}} (or
\code{\linkS4class{LogisticLogNormal}}) object.
}
\details{
Based on the proposal by Neuenschwander et al (2008, Statistics in
Medicine), a minimally informative prior distribution is constructed. The
required key input is the minimum (\eqn{d_{1}} in the notation of the
Appendix A.1 of that paper) and the maximum value (\eqn{d_{J}}) of the dose
grid supplied to this function. Then \code{threshmin} is the probability
threshold \eqn{q_{1}}, such that any probability of DLT larger than
\eqn{q_{1}} has only 5\% probability. Therefore \eqn{q_{1}} is the 95\%
quantile of the beta distribution and hence \eqn{p_{1} = 0.95}. Likewise,
\code{threshmax} is the probability threshold \eqn{q_{J}}, such that any
probability of DLT smaller than \eqn{q_{J}} has only 5\% probability
(\eqn{p_{J} = 0.05}). The probabilities \eqn{1 - p_{1}} and \eqn{p_{J}} can be
controlled with the arguments \code{probmin} and \code{probmax}, respectively.
Subsequently, for all doses supplied in the
\code{dosegrid} argument, beta distributions are set up from the assumption
that the prior medians are linear in log-dose on the logit scale, and
\code{\link{Quantiles2LogisticNormal}} is used to transform the resulting
quantiles into an approximating \code{\linkS4class{LogisticNormal}} (or
\code{\linkS4class{LogisticLogNormal}}) model. Note that the reference dose
is not required for these computations.
