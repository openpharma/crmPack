\usage{
examine(object, ..., maxNoIncrement = 100L)

\S4method{examine}{Design}(object, mcmcOptions = McmcOptions(), ..., maxNoIncrement)

\S4method{examine}{RuleDesign}(object, ..., maxNoIncrement = 100L)

}
\arguments{
\item{object}{the design (\code{\linkS4class{Design}} or
\code{\linkS4class{RuleDesign}} object) we want to examine}

\item{\dots}{additional arguments (see methods)}

\item{maxNoIncrement}{maximum number of contiguous next doses at 0
DLTs that are the same as before, i.e. no increment (default to 100)}

\item{mcmcOptions}{object of class \code{\linkS4class{McmcOptions}},
giving the MCMC options for each evaluation in the trial. By default,
the standard options are used}
}
\value{
The data frame
}
\description{
This generic function takes a design and generates a dataframe
showing the beginning of several hypothetical trial courses under
the design. This means, from the generated dataframe one can read off:
\itemize{
\item how many cohorts are required in the optimal case (no DLTs observed) in
order to reach the highest dose of the specified dose grid (or until
the stopping rule is fulfilled)
\item assuming no DLTs are observed until a certain dose level, what the next
recommended dose is for all possible number of DLTs observed
\item the actual relative increments that will be used in these cases
\item whether the trial would stop at a certain cohort
Examining the "single trial" behavior of a dose escalation design is
the first important step in evaluating a design, and cannot be replaced by
studying solely the operating characteristics in "many trials". The cohort
sizes are also taken from the design, assuming no DLTs occur until the dose
listed.
