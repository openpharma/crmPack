----------------------------------------------------------------
ROLLING CRM:

- Not critical but worth to check - could be known limitation for PEMs:
  Using an informative Gamma prior for lambda did not produce stable results.
  How could this be done? would need proper documentation in help files/vignette

- Still todo before submission: C_par needs better documentation (name is OK)

- For `trueTmax`: add argument documentation here

- `DADesign` simulations: there could be errors if DLT occurs between the 2-3 patients,
    when the 3rd patient has't been dosed yet.

- `simulations.Rmd`: Fix the problem with `factSurv` being negative and
  then reenable simulation runs.

- Later: write a vignette (in Rmd format?) for rolling CRM, to make it easier
  to start with this kind of design

- Later: Convert TITE CRM demo file to vignette in Rmd format (same as for rolling CRM
  demo). Reason is that vignettes are routinely checked and easier to find
  than demos.

- make nextOpen a part of the DAdesign object

- update method for `DataDA`: need to do like in `DataParts`, i.e. use underlying Data update
  method first and then more changes according to `DataDA`.
  Also we would expect arguments `x`, `y`, `u`, and `ID`.

- plot method for `DataDA`: insert example code in example file (still empty)

- update `SafetyWindowConst`with different slots

- `NextBestNCRM`: need an example here for `DataParts`.

- Document `safetyWindow` in `DADesign`.

- `prob`: simplify this to always vectorize internally over points so that we
  always take/return matrix.

- Finish documenting `plotDualResponses`.

- `fitPEM`: Document `hazard` completely.

- `PseudoSimulations`: Document `stopReasons`.

- `DALogisticLogNormal`: Better would be to sample here also the interval probabilities
   for having a DLT. This can also be nicely summarized later. We can then
   put the additional parameter name in `sample`. Currently they are
   calculated in the plot step.

   Also explain why `l` is defined as is. Starting point:
   Using the same assumption in Liu, Yin, Yuan 2013, it is assumed that a priori toxicity occurs
   uniformly throughout the assessment period (0, Tmax), which represents a neutral prior opinion
   between early-onset and late-onset toxicity. Under this assumption, the hazard at the middle of
   the kth partition is caluclated as the `lambda_prior` function.

----------------------------------------------------------------
BUGFIXES:

no current known bugs


----------------------------------------------------------------
IMPROVEMENTS:

- add warning if the MinimalInformative prior or similar return a prior variance
  that is very low (to prevent undeliberately strong priors!)

- add a customized simulation summary function for the dual endpoint models,
  which also reports the frequency of simulated trials selecting the correct OBD

- also optimize refDose for quantile->logistic functions

- make sure that it is clear in the documentation that the log transformation
  only applies to the slope (beta) and not to the intercept (alpha)

- the minimalInformative function should already produce a graph comparing the
  required and the resulting quantiles, instead of the user having to do it.

- record number of times the model is overruled in the simulations (Uli Beyer
request)

- mixture prior: add documentation in vignette

- allow different x values (doses) to be specified in simulate() to be passed to fit()

----------------------------------------------------------------
NEW FEATURES:

- add slide production with ReporteRs package examples (to demo folder?)

- be able to run simulations on a cluster: use the BatchJobs package that is installed
  on the new Roche HPC - potentially as different fork of the package??

- production of Word output tables from simulation summaries

- minimal informative prior construction for other model(s), especially the probit model
  to allow construction for the dual endpoint models.

- other prior in the Kadane model -> how?

- historical data prior,
  pseudodata prior
