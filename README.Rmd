The goal of crmPack is to implement a wide range of model-based dose
escalation designs, ranging from classical and modern continual
reassessment methods (CRMs) based on dose-limiting toxicity endpoints to
dual-endpoint designs taking into account a biomarker/efficacy outcome. The
focus is on Bayesian inference, making it very easy to setup a new design
with your own JAGS code. However, it is also possible to implement 3+3
designs for comparison or models with non-Bayesian estimation. The whole
package is written in a modular form in the S4 class system, making it very
flexible for adaptation to new models, escalation or stopping rules.
