# `Recruitment`

**\[experimental\]**

`Recruitment` is a virtual class for recruitment criteria, from which
all other specific recruitment criteria classes inherit. The subclasses
are used to specify the maximum number of backfill patients that can be
recruited relative to the main trial cohort size.

## Usage

``` r
.DefaultRecruitment()
```

## Note

Typically, end users will not use the `.DefaultRecruitment()` function.
