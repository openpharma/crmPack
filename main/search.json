Historically, patients treated dose cohorts three, dose next cohort determined number DLTs observed current cohort.

Fundamentally, escalation rules 3+3 design statistical justification (Storer 1989) terms estimating MTD. Moreover, extended address today’s Phase trials, extension cohorts, dose escalation drug combinations optimal biological dose determination, naming just prominent challenges.

Plotting result gives overview final dose recommendations trial trajectories, also summary biomarker variance correlation estimates simulations:  Finally, summary simulations can obtained corresponding function: see trials proceeded maximum sample size 40 patients (reaching 42 cohort size 3). doses selected lower toxicity target range, aiming biomarker target instead, true biomarker response peaked 50 mg. corresponding plot looks follows:  see average biomarker fit bad range 50 mg, toxicity curve fit bad — probably result low frequency DLTs. warning : dual-endpoint designs still experimental!

First, define data sets dual responses using DataDual function just like example given last subsection. example, data2 empty data set 12 dose levels, 25 300 mg increments 25 mg used. variable data4 contains data set binary DLT continuous efficacy responses observations. elements slot x dose levels 8 subjects treated. elements slot y represent corresponding binary DLT responses observed 8 subjects elements slot w represent continuous efficacy responses obtained 8 subjects. Similarly, can also obtain plot data sets using plot function described last subsection. described, model two responses separately. order , use models inheriting ModelPseudo class. binary DLT responses, can use models inheriting ModelTox class. example use models inheriting LogisticIndepBeta class variable DLTmodel (newDLTmodel observations) given previous examples. continuous efficacy responses, can use models inheriting ModelEff class. current version package, two model classes, Effloglog EffFlexi model, inheriting ModelEff class. Since ModelEff also inheriting ModelPseudo class, prior efficacy model also needs specified form pseudo data.

Note , since gamma distribution used prior distribution ν\\nu, posterior distribution gamma distribution, gamma prior precision conjugate normal likelihood. fixed value precision preferred, single positive scalar can also specified nu slot. Finally Data slot specified either empty data set data set currently available observations.

Increments, CohortSize Stopping rules classes described earlier can applied . now look additional nextBest Stopping classes rules can use situation. , decision choosing next best dose administration based gain function defined (Yeung et al. 2015). gain function represents trade-DLT efficacy responses allocate dose gives best trade-responses. words, dose gives maximum gain value dose allocated next cohort subjects. basic ideas rules follows. % old text: Assume DLT observed subject, gain value observed particular dose level obtained multiplying probability DLT observed dose levels expected efficacy responses DLT observed particular dose level. %new: gain value particular dose level obtained multiplying probability DLT dose level expected efficacy response dose level. data accumulates trial, estimate gain function improve. gain function consists two components, one part DLT responses efficacy response. depends values obtained components affect values gain. example, ideal case probability DLT expected value efficacy response high. gain value obtained high. reason dose gives maximum gain value allocated next cohort subjects. can plot gain function given DLT model specified ModelTox class efficacy model specified ModelEff class using plotGain function. example, using variables newDLTmodel, newEffmodel data set observations, data4, specified earlier examples, :  case MCMC sampling involved prior posterior modal estimates model parameters used. two implemented nextBest rules dual responses using gain function: NextBestMaxGain NextBestMaxGainSamples class object.

Furthermore, can also plot, summarize plot summary simulated results using plot summary function:    plots give overview final dose recommendations trial trajectories. addition, also give summary efficacy variance also random walk model variance EffFlexi class object used efficacy model. , summary plot summary simulations can obtained :    first simulation, Sim1 trial stop ratio 95% credibility interval bounds current estimate minimum TD30(TDtargetEndOfTrial) Gstar less equal 5. last two simulations, Sim2 Sim3, use trials stop either maximum 72 patients treated ratio 95% credibility interval less equal 5. can see simulations trials require total around 60 patients study. reminder, dual endpoint dose escalation design uses two separate models describe dose-responses relationship, gain function used determine next best dose final recommended dose end trial. specifically end trial, recommend dose level closest minimum final estimate TD30 (TDtargetEndOfTrial) Gstar. DLT efficacy scenario used first, Sim1 second simulations, Sim2 . real TD30 (TDtargetEndOfTrial) given summary 152.6125 mg dose level doseGrid closest real TD30 150 mg. real Gstar 130.0097 mg dose level dose grid closest Gstar 125 mg. case, real Gstar less real TD30 expect recommendations made dose level close real Gstar. words, scenario, expect recommendations made 125 mg. can see simulated results agrees expecting. summaries plots summaries, 125 mg dose level selected often simulations. scenario last simulation, Sim3, real TD30 real Gstar 125 mg. Since real TD30 greater real Gstar, also expect recommendations made close real Gstar scenario. can see simulated results summary plot summary, procedure also recommends 125 mg often simulations, agrees real scenario. Now, also look fitted dose-DLT dose-efficacy curves obtained three simulations. plots summaries, can see cases, fitted dose-DLT curves (solid-red curve) approximate well real dose-DLT curve (solid-black curve). 95% credibility interval DLT curve (broken-red curves) also given MCMC samples involved simulation. contrast, can see fitted efficacy curve (solid-blue curve) gives good fit real efficacy curve (solid-black) cases. approximation real efficacy curve better linear linear log-log model, Effloglog used, compared flexible form , EffFlexi used. addition, can also see 95% credibility interval efficacy curve (broken-blue line) MCMC sampling efficacy responses involved.","code":"data2 <- DataDual(doseGrid = seq(25, 300, 25))  data4 <- DataDual(   x = c(25, 50, 50, 75, 100, 100, 225, 300),   y = c(0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1),   ID = as.integer(1:8),   cohort = as.integer(c(1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6)),   w = c(0.31, 0.42, 0.59, 0.45, 0.6, 0.7, 0.6, 0.52),   doseGrid = seq(25, 300, 25) ) Effmodel <- Effloglog(   eff = c(1.223, 2.513),   eff_dose = c(25, 300),   nu = c(a = 1, b = 0.025),   data = data2 ) str(Effmodel) ##
