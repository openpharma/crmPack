##Obtain the 'fit' the middle, uppper and lower quantiles for the dose-DLE curve
## at all dose levels using a DLE sample, a DLE model and the data
## samples must be from 'Samples' class (object slot)
## we need a data object with doses >= 1:
data <- Data(
  x = c(25, 50, 50, 75, 150, 200, 225, 300),
  y = c(0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1),
  doseGrid = seq(from = 25, to = 300, by = 25)
)
## model must be from 'Model' or 'ModelTox' class e.g using 'LogisticIbdepBeta' model class
model <- LogisticIndepBeta(
  binDLE = c(1.05, 1.8),
  DLEweights = c(3, 3),
  DLEdose = c(25, 300),
  data = data
)
##options for MCMC
options <- McmcOptions(burnin = 100, step = 2, samples = 200)
## samples must be from 'Samples' class (object slot in fit)
samples <- mcmc(data, model, options)

fit(object = samples, model = model, data = data)
