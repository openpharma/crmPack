#' @section Usage Notes:
#' This section describes the use of `label` and `tox_label`, collectively
#' referred to as `label`s.
#' A `label` should be a scalar or a vector of length 2.  If a scalar, it is
#' converted by adding a second element that is equal to the first, suffixed by `s`.
#' For example, `tox_label = "DLT"` becomes `tox_label = c("DLT", "DLTs")`.  The
#' first element of the vector is used to describe a count of 1.  The second
#' is used in all other cases.
